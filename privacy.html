<h2>Data Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Our website  may be used without entering personal information. Different rules may apply to  certain services on our site, however, and are explained separately below. We  collect personal information from you (e.g. name, address, email address,  telephone number, etc.) in accordance with the provisions of German data  protection statutes. Information is considered personal if it can be associated  exclusively to a specific natural person. The legal framework for data  protection may be found in the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the  Telemedia Act (TMG). The provisions below serve to provide information as to  the manner, extent and purpose for collecting, using and processing personal  information by the provider.</p>
<p><strong><a href="about.html">Andreas Treubert</a></strong></p>
<p>    Please be  aware that data transfer via the internet is subject to security risks and,  therefore, complete protection against third-party access to transferred data  cannot be ensured.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>Our website  makes use of so-called cookies in order to recognize repeat use of our website  by the same user/internet connection subscriber. Cookies are small text files  that your internet browser downloads and stores on your computer. They are used  to improve our website and services. In most cases these are so-called "session  cookies" that are deleted once you leave our website.</p>
<p> To an extent, however, these cookies also pass along information used to automatically  recognize you. Recognition occurs through an IP address saved to the cookies. The  information thereby obtained is used to improve our services and to expedite  your access to the website.</p>
<p> You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your  browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you  may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website.</p>

<h4>Server Data</h4>
<p>For  technical reasons, data such as the following, which your internet browser  transmits to us or to our web space provider (so called server log files), is  collected: 
      
      - type and version of the browser you use 
      - operating system 
      - websites that linked you to our site (referrer URL) 
      - websites that you visit 
      - date and time of your visit 
      - your Internet Protocol (IP) address. 
  
      This anonymous data is stored separately from any personal information you may  have provided, thereby making it impossible to connect it to any particular  person. The data is used for statistical purposes in order to improve our  website and services.</p>

<h4>Use of Google Analytics with anonymization</h4>
<p>Our website  uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service from Google Inc., 1600  Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter referred to as "Google".  Google Analytics employs so-called “cookies“, text files that are stored to  your computer in order to facilitate an analysis of your use of the site.
The information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and frequency  of your visits to our site, including your IP address, is transmitted to Google's  location in the US and stored there.
In using Google Analytics our website employs the extension, "_gat._anonymizeIp".  In doing so, Google abbreviates and thereby anonymizes your IP address before  transferring it from member states of the European Union or signatory states to  the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
Google uses this information to analyze your use of our site, to compile  reports for us on internet activity and to provide other services relating to  website and internet use. Google may also transfer this information to third  parties where required to do so by law or where such third parties process this  data on Google's behalf.&nbsp;
Google states that it will in never associate your IP address with other data  held by Google. You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the  settings on your browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however,  that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of  our website.
Furthermore,  Google offers a deactivation add-on for most current browsers that provides you  with more control over what data Google can collect on websites you access. The  add-on tells the JavaScript (ga.js) used by Google Analytics not to transmit  any information about website visits to Google Analytics. However, the browser deactivation  add-on offered by Google Analytics does not prevent information from being  transmitted to us or to other web analysis services we may engage. You can find  additional information on how to install the browser add-on at the following  link:</p>

<h3>Information/Cancellation/Deletion</h3>
<p>On the basis  of the Federal Data Protection Act, you may contact us at no cost if you have  questions relating to the collection, processing or use of your personal  information, if you wish to request the correction, blocking or deletion of the  same, or if you wish to cancel explicitly granted consent. Please note that you  have the right to have incorrect data corrected or to have personal data  deleted, where such claim is not barred by any legal obligation to retain this  data.</p>
